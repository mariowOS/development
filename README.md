## A work-in-progress clean, fast, smooth web-based OS experience.

This is the main development repo, which contains the whole code that we work on prior compressing to stable images for generic devices.

### Clone repository

```
$ mkdir mariowOS
$ cd mariowOS
$ git clone https://github.com/mariowOS/development
```

### External services notices

If you want to build mariowOS for other specific devices (such as tablets, laptops) or for an organization make sure you have every external service (ex. update mirrors) changed before publishing. either the official generic is gonna overwrite yours at every update.

For organizations you can set up the **Temp** account that gets flushed at every logoff, can be useful if you have multiple people that use that device (ex. a library). Temp account has no administrative rights and can't modify anything on the system. Backend is limited, external services are too.
